Choose your class: Rogue, Knight, Samurai, Pirate, Prophet.
You are a banished.
You have to make your way back to The Midland of Karst.
You have to fight numerous mini-bosses before killing the Harbinger of Death.
The Harbinger of Death has taken over your homeland and brought you to death's curtain.
Every time you beat one of the three mini-bosses (Aurelia, the Weeping Angel; Nero, Saint of Death;Decimus of Karst) you recieve a piece of the Crown of Creation which you must use to defeat The Harbinger of Death and create a new empire.

# Beginning:
You wake up, mind blank and not a thought in your head and observe your surroundings. A dark, ashen desert streches as far as the eye can see.
You start walking until you can't feel your legs, manouvering yourself through darkened caverns and avoiding vultures circling around you, knowing your imminent death
Just as you're on the brink of giving up, you see something in the distance, a large gate blocks the entrance to The Midland of Karst, a place you once called home, and suddenly all the memories start rushing back.
You were once the Army General of this decayed country, fighting in wars that killed hundreds but ensured your success a society, until one day a threat came that you couldn't beat...

The Harbinger of Death, the name rings in your head like a migrain.
How can such evil exist in the world, you think to yourself.
All was well in the Midland, no new wars in just shy of 8 years, then, a figure came from the ominous ravine at the edge of town.
At first he was accepted, made one of our own, but the second he laid eyes on the Crown of Creation, obsession overpowered him and we found out he wasn't here to make friends
